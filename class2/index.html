      <h2>Early Life</h2>
      <p>
        Albert Einstein was born in Ulm,[19] in the Kingdom of Württemberg in
        the German Empire, on 14 March 1879.[20][21] His parents, secular
        Ashkenazi Jews, were Hermann Einstein, a salesman and engineer, and
        Pauline Koch. In 1880, the family moved to Munich, where Einstein's
        father and his uncle Jakob founded Elektrotechnische Fabrik J. Einstein
        & Cie, a company that manufactured electrical equipment based on direct
        current.[19] Albert attended a Catholic elementary school in Munich from
        the age of five. When he was eight, he was transferred to the
        Luitpold-Gymnasium (now known as the Albert-Einstein-Gymnasium) where he
        received advanced primary and then secondary school education.[22]

        Correspondence between Einstein and Marić, discovered and published in
        1987, revealed that in early 1902, while Marić was visiting her parents
        in Novi Sad, she gave birth to a daughter, Lieserl. When Marić returned
        to Switzerland it was without the child, whose fate is uncertain. A
        letter of Einstein's that he wrote in September 1903 suggests that the
        girl was either given up for adoption or died of scarlet fever in
        infancy.[45][46]

        <span>Einstein</span> and Marić married in January 1903. In May 1904,
        their son Hans Albert was born in Bern, Switzerland. Their son Eduard
        was born in Zürich in July 1910. In letters that Einstein wrote to Marie
        Winteler in the months before Eduard's arrival, he described his love
        for his wife as "misguided" and mourned the "missed life" that he
        imagined he would have enjoyed if he had married Winteler instead: "I
        think of you in heartfelt love every spare minute and am so unhappy as
        only a man can be.

      <h2>1900–1905: First scientific papers</h2>
      <p>
        Einstein's first paper, "Folgerungen aus den Capillaritätserscheinungen"
        ("Conclusions drawn from the phenomena of capillarity"), in which he
        proposed a model of intermolecular attraction that he afterwards
        disavowed as worthless, was published in the journal Annalen der Physik
        in 1900.[77][78] His 24-page doctoral dissertation also addressed a
        topic in molecular physics. Titled "Eine neue Bestimmung der
        Moleküldimensionen" ("A New Determination of Molecular Dimensions") and
        dedicated to his friend Marcel Grossman, it was completed on 30 April
        1905[79] and approved by Professor Alfred Kleiner of the University of
        Zurich three months later. (Einstein was formally awarded his PhD on 15
        January 1906.)[79][80][81] Four other pieces of work that Einstein
        completed in 1905—his famous papers on the photoelectric effect,
        Brownian motion, his special theory of relativity and the equivalence of
        mass and energy—have led to the year's being celebrated as an annus
        mirabilis for physics almost as wonderful as 1666 (the year in which
        Isaac Newton experienced his greatest epiphanies). The publications
        deeply impressed Einstein's contemporaries.[
