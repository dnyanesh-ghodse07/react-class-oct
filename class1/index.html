        <strong> Maria Salomea Skłodowska-Curie</strong> (Polish: [ˈmarja
        salɔˈmɛa skwɔˈdɔfska kʲiˈri] ⓘ; née Skłodowska; 7 November 1867 – 4 July
        1934), known simply as Marie Curie (/ˈkjʊəri/ KURE-ee,[4] French: [maʁi
        kyʁi]), was a Polish and naturalized-French physicist and chemist who
        conducted pioneering research on radioactivity. She was the first woman
        to win a Nobel Prize, the first person to win a Nobel Prize twice, and
        the only person to win a Nobel Prize in two scientific fields. Her
        husband, Pierre Curie, was a co-winner of her first Nobel Prize, making
        them the first-ever married couple to win the Nobel Prize and launching
        the Curie family legacy of five Nobel Prizes. She was, in 1906, the
        first woman to become a professor at the University of Paris.[5]
